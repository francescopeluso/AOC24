# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code '24

These are my AOC '24 submissions. \
I will be using mostly Python to solve these problems, I don't even know if I will be able to complete all of them in time.

---

This code will probably be garbage and some (or maybe all) of the problems will be solved in the most inefficient way (after all, I will be using Python which is slow as hell, lol)

---

Puzzle inputs are available [here](https://adventofcode.com/2024), just log in with your account and solve the problems.
